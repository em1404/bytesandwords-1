<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
I work at the Office of Marketing and Public Relations for Messiah College, in the Old Main building.  My supervisors are Ramona Fritschi, Web Services Manager, and Kris Hardy, the Director of Web Communications.  I had two primary learning objectives for my internship this fall.  The first was to gain a proficient knowledge of client-side web development (web development without server-side scripts and databases) and management by receiving training in content management systems (CMSs), specifically Jadu (the one that we are using), completing online tutorials on basic HTML and CSS, learning how to use development and design tools such as Photoshop and Dreamweaver, and to use all of this learning to perform simple tasks and to assist with larger projects that my supervisors are coordinating.  The second learning objective was to learn how organizations and groups use websites and web applications for practical purpose by sitting in on a meeting with a client, observing patterns in what they expressed as needs for their website, being able to discern whether or not their desires for their website are really desirable or feasible in the long run, and being able to provide solutions.
</p>
<p><strong>Work/Projects</strong><br>
Much of my work in the first few weeks included minor editing (changing words, fixing punctuation and capitalization, replacing old hyperlinks with new ones) while I acclimated to the work environment and honed my development skills.  As the semester progressed, and as my capability increased, I was gradually eased into bigger and more complex projects like building out wireframes for new pages, and eventually migrating and merging content to fit the new pages.  I built some surveys, forms and tables too (some in Jadu, some not).  I was able to sit in on a conversation with the English department chair in regards to the redevelopment of their website (partially because I’m a work study for the English department), and took part in a focus group meeting on the subject of redesigning Messiah’s website. Eventually, we began an ongoing project of developing new academic offerings pages for all concentrations and minors that the college offers.  That is a project that has had many stages and we are using an online project management application called Basecamp to organize our efforts.  My part in that project included gathering resources, creating pages, and offering feedback to the people who were creating content.  That project has been a main focus of my time recently, in addition to migrating other websites into the Jadu CMS.
</p>
<p><strong>Learning</strong><br>
I have learned <em>a lot</em> this semester.  I have learned working skills, how to use HTML and CSS for example, and I have gained workplace insight, the dynamics of a group of people trying to accomplish something.  I have learned that sometimes things come easy and I should keep going on that momentum and enthusiasm until my task is completed, but I have also learned that many things will be difficult—mentally straining because tasks are either complex or tedious—but to honor God and give it all, which develops perseverance.  I learned how to search for answers using the internet, and I learned when and how to ask effective questions to my supervisors.  I think that is actually one of the most important things I’m learning: the discernment of when I should try to figure out how/what to do with the abilities and knowledge that I have versus asking for guidance, clarification, and help.  It’s a tight balance, good to err on the side of asking for help, but still a tricky thing to do.  I think that I’ve learned to reflect upon what my supervisors have done or said in the past and make judgments based on those precedents, but to always be in communication with them, especially when I’m not sure.  Strangely, I think this has been a reflection of my relationship with God as well.
</p>
<p><strong>Future Plans</strong><br>
I think that, even though I haven’t had any classes in web development, this is a type of occupation that I would be comfortable doing.  Although my mind gets fuzzy after staring at a computer for a long time (I would need stretch breaks and windows), I think my experience of constantly adapting and learning new things would enable me to work effectively in this field.  The issues that arise from the constantly evolving world of information technology grow at an exponential rate, however, which creates a lot of stress.  I don’t think I’d take on a job in this field in which I would not be part of a team, because sharing one another’s burdens is vital.  But having this internship has definitely increased my interest and optimism in regards to the field of web development, and it will definitely remain a solid work option in the future.
</p>
<p><strong>Preparation/Recommendations</strong><br>
My major itself helped me prepare for this internship because I have had to learn to learn.  In almost all of my classes I’ve had to learn new programming languages and perspectives, and that mindset of adaptability is extremely useful to professional developers of any kind.  I have not had any classes dealing directly with my work in this internship, and the fact that I do not have time to take web development classes is one of the reasons why I chose this particular internship.  As I mentioned before, most of the technical skills I have learned I have gained from either the instruction of my supervisors and coworkers, or from online tutorials.  I used the tutorials on codecademy.com, which I found more engaging as I learned new and unfamiliar material, but after learning the basics, I found that w3schools.com was more streamlined for finding what I needed to know (glossaries, topical organization instead of lessons).  Both websites have been extremely useful to me in different ways.  
</p>
<p>My experience with the English department has also been helpful, because I got to interact with both sides of the development process—the user end and the developer end.  Having a foot in both camps helped me understand the role of information technology in the world—not just in the developer office or classroom.</p>
<p>I recommend that the CIS major keep the internship requirement, because it really is a class in itself.  In addition to gaining working skills, it is a hands-on class on the working world and its complexities.</p>
