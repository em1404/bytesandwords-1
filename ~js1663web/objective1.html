<p><strong>Reflective Summary</strong><br>
I honestly did not know what to expect when I came into the fall semester, in regards to what my internship would look like and what I would learn from it. I knew that I'd have to learn some new things since I hadn't taken any official web development classes prior to starting. I can say now though that I have learned much more than I ever thought I would (mainly because I didn't really put too much thought into it) not only about what life is like in a professional working setting, but also practical skills and knowledge.  I had no academic experience using HTML, and no experience, period, with CSS, but now I have managed to not only survive and thrive in my current position, but build this website, too!  I wrote the points in this learning objective at the beginning of the semester, when I didn't really know the full scope of what my job would entail, and I think that might be why my expectations have been far surpassed. I had no idea what responsibilities I would be given once I started getting the hang of things. I am very thankful to my supervisors for their patience and willingness to let me learn by involvement; although I learned most of the skills from online tutorials, they showed me wisdom in how to use that knowledge effectively. They trusted me enough to give me projects that were not always straightforward, and that required critical thinking and research - for which I am very grateful. Overall, I am convinced that I have met and exceeded this learning objective, and I would like to thank my supervisors and my internship advisors again for allowing me this opportunity to grow.
