<p><strong>Reflective Summary</strong><br>
As I said in the reflection for the first learning objective, when I wrote these, I didn't really know the full extent of what I'd be doing as an intern. I believe that I have fulfilled this learning objective (and it has been quite significant in my learning process), however, though I only had direct interaction with a client once. That was with the English department chair, whom I am also employed by per diem as a work study, and who had approached me in the past on the subject of creating/revamping the English department's website. That had been a long process, and finally, work got under way, although another student had offered to take that duty as a class project. I was at the meeting with both the English department chair and my supervisors, in which they discussed the practicality of certain designs (the desired ones were not compatible with Jadu, to our knowledge), and the desired content and modifications. It was a very intriguing process because I was able to see the communication between developers and clients, and noticing the kinds of questions that both the developers and the clients asked each other, to figure out either what they could do, or what was considered a necessity for the website. It was a complicated process which required clear and frequent communication on both sides.<br>I also had the opportunity to be part of focus group, in which the marketing and development staff asked us about the school's website, our usage of it, and what we liked or didn't like. That was interesting because my fellow students and I were the clients in that situation. An interesting thing that I was thinking about as I reflected on these meetings was that I have not been alive at a time when there was no World Wide Web. I've never thought about <em>why</em> web pages exist, or what thought is put into their design and content, but have just accepted that they were part of life.  I now have an idea of the marketing value and their usefulness as a tool for information access, and understand the importance of designing and building web pages well in order to benefit the intended audiences.  In that light, I believe that I have realized this learning objective too.
